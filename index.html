<p> If you're not a fan of a tropical vacation, go to Baguio, a city found in Northern Luzon. Although the road from Manila to Baguio is long, the trip is worth it as you are able to see many famous landmarks such as the Lion's Head, a statue located along Kennon Road, which is a road part of the route to Baguio; and many cliffs and greenery. Being on top of a mountain, Baguio<span id="m1a1"> is cold, which is perfect for tourists who come from colder climates.</span> Even if there are no beaches, there are many activities one can do in Baguio such as strawberry-picking from Baguio's strawberry farms, visit the monuments and learn more about Filipino history, or ride the swan boats and take a stroll in nature at Burnham Park. Just like the previous items, there are many things one can do in Baguio, making a memorable and enjoyable trip.</p>

<p> If you want to explore other lands in the Philippines aside from Luzon and Visayas, try Davao City. Davao is a city located in Mindanao.  It has <span id="m1a1">many monuments and interesting places and parks</span>, such as Eden Park, where one can bike across a cliff, or learn more about the history of the Philippines by visiting its many monuments or dropping by the Davao Museum. Another good thing about Davao is that you can hunt for pearls in its special "Pearl Farm", whose title is self-explanatory. For tourists who are fellow muslims and would like to travel to Mindanao, Davao is the way to go. </p>

<p> Aside from Palawan, you can find one of the cleanest beaches in Cebu. Cebu is a city located in Visayas, and it has much more to it aside from beaches. <span id="m1a1">There are shrines, monuments, and many luxurious hotels </span>for a foreigner to rest in. Just like the others, you can learn more about the detailed backstory of our country and be amazed by the tiny details found on our monuments,  and at the same time buy souvenirs on the beachside before you take a dive. For foreigners who want convinience stores nearby for just a trip to the beach, Cebu is your choice.</p>
